ROLE: You are a coding agent onboarding this repository for GitHub Copilot coding agent + Copilot Chat.

MISSION:
Create and commit the following files (or improve them if they already exist):
1) /AGENTS.md
2) /.github/copilot-instructions.md
3) /.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml

REFERENCE MATERIAL (READ FIRST — SOURCE OF TRUTH):
Use these pages for required filenames, formats, and behavior:
- GitHub Docs: Add repository instructions (copilot-instructions.md + AGENTS.md usage)

- GitHub Docs: Customize the agent environment (copilot-setup-steps.yml requirements)
  https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment
- GitHub Docs: Best results / best practices for Copilot coding agent tasks (good task patterns, validation mindset)

DISCOVERY (DO THIS BEFORE WRITING FILES):
Inspect THIS repository to learn real commands and conventions:
- README, CONTRIBUTING, docs/, ADRs
- Existing CI workflows in .github/workflows (treat as the source of truth for build/test/lint)
- Build/tooling/version files: .tool-versions, .nvmrc, global.json, go.mod, pyproject.toml, package.json, etc.
- Lint/format configs: eslint/prettier, ruff/black, golangci-lint, dotnet format, etc.
- Test frameworks and how tests run in CI
- Required env vars, local services/containers, DB migrations, .env.example, secrets patterns

DELIVERABLES (WHAT TO CREATE):

1) /AGENTS.md
Purpose: A single “README for agents” with the minimum context needed to succeed fast.

Must include sections (keep concise + bullet-heavy):
A) Project snapshot
- Tech stack, major components/services, key directories (10–20 bullets max)

B) Golden commands (MOST IMPORTANT)
- Install deps
- Run/dev
- Build
- Test: fast vs full suite (if applicable)
- Lint/format/typecheck
Use commands that match CI workflows. If uncertain, add a TODO and point to where to confirm (e.g., specific workflow file).

C) Project map
- What each top-level folder is for + any “do not touch” areas

D) Guardrails & safety
- Never commit secrets
- How to use .env.example / secret management approach used here
- Avoid destructive commands unless explicitly requested

E) Definition of Done (MANDATORY)
When the agent finishes any code change, it must ensure:
- Tests: Add or update tests for new/changed behavior (or explicitly justify why no tests are needed).
- Docs: Update relevant documentation (README/docs/usage notes) when behavior, configuration, or developer workflow changes.
- Validation: Run the relevant checks locally (or via documented commands) before opening a PR.
- PR hygiene: small diffs, clear summary, mention commands run + results.

2) /.github/copilot-instructions.md
Purpose: Repo-wide Copilot guidance read on every request.

Include:
- “How this repo is structured” (very short)
- Key coding conventions and architectural rules that matter here
- Validation checklist (exact commands to run before PR)
- Testing expectations (when to add tests; fast vs full suite)
- Docs expectations (when to update docs; what docs are authoritative here)
- A note: “AGENTS.md is the primary operating manual for agents in this repo.”

Keep it short and high-signal. Avoid generic boilerplate.

3) /.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml
Purpose: Prepare the Copilot coding agent environment before it starts working.

Hard requirements (from GitHub Docs):
- Path must be exactly: .github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml
- Must contain a single job named EXACTLY: copilot-setup-steps
- Keep permissions minimal (typically contents: read if using checkout)

Workflow behavior requirements:
- Checkout repo (if needed)
- Install required runtimes/toolchains based on repo reality (match CI version pins if available)
- Install dependencies
- Add caching where appropriate for the stack
- Prefer a minimal validation step that enables the agent to run tests/linters (keep it reliable; avoid flaky integration steps unless necessary)
- Include workflow_dispatch
- Include push and pull_request triggers limited to changes of this workflow file (paths filter) so it’s easy to validate

QUALITY BAR / ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Every documented command must be consistent with repo files and CI workflows.
- If something is unknown, add a TODO + a concrete pointer to confirm (file path, script name, workflow name).
- Do not add any extra instruction systems beyond the three deliverables.
- Commit in 1–2 commits with clear messages (e.g., “chore: add Copilot agent onboarding files”).

OUTPUT:
Provide a PR (preferred) or a patch/commit that adds/updates these files, plus a short summary of what changed and why.
Include which validation commands were run and their results (or explain why they weren’t run).
